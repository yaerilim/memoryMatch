# Memory Match

## Overview

> Memory match is a game with 18 cards face down and the player has to try and match all 9 pairs of matching cards by remembering the position of the cards.
Once the player has match 2 cards they will be displayed face up until all pairs have been matched. Once all pairs have been matched the user will be
displayed a message that they have won the game. As the user clicks through the cards stats will be kept letting the user know how many attempts and the
accuracy of their choices.

# Memory Match - Version 0.5 (v0.5)

#### Overview
> Version 0.5 is where we combine the basic JS skills we learned through the presentations & prototypes and apply it towards the v0.1 HTML structure. We will be adding the basic functionality to match cards as they are clicked and determine if the game is won by the user.

> For this version we will be breaking down the programmatic flow and explaining the decisions that the program has to make to fully understand how the user is interacting. As we move further into the program we will be showing less and less of the flow and expect a certain level of understanding of logical flow. The diagram below should help you follow along with the bullet points.

    - **I dont know** Run the command below
        - `git branch` - this will highlight the branch you are currently on
    - **No** - Make sure you `git add .` and `git commit` to your current branch before you switch to your master branch
> - Pull Latest Changes    
        - `git checkout master`
        - `git pull origin master` - **Now continue with the next steps**
> - Create a feature branch
    - `git checkout -b v0.5`
> - Work on the scope defined <a href="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/memory_match/tree/v0.5#scope">Below</a>
> - Save your work to gitHub

#### Scope

> - Create 4 card static layout by removing 7 of the nine matching cards
> - Add a click handler to each card by 1 of these 2 methods
>   - jQuery - Intermediate
>       - Add click method to a jQuery Selector with the parameter equal to a function called card_clicked
>   - onclick attribute - Fundamentals
>       - the value of the attribute on each element should be set to card_clicked with a parameter of the keyword this
> - Declare and assign 3 global (see scope presentation) variables
>   - **first_card_clicked** assigned to null
>   - **second_card_clicked** assigned to null
>   - **total_possible_matches** assign to number of total possible matches (in this case 2)
>   - **match_counter** assigned to 0
> - Declare card_clicked function in the script.js file with the following functionality in it
>   - Show the card face
>   - Check if variable first_card_clicked is null
>       - **true** - assign first_card_clicked equal to the html DOM Element that was clicked
>           - click handler functionality is complete, return
>       - **false** - assign second_card_clicked to the html DOM Element that was clicked
>           - check if first_card_clicked is equivalent to the second_card_clicked
>               - **true**
>                   - increment match_counter by 1
>                   - reset both variables defined above to null again and then wait for next card click
>                   - check if match_counter is equivalent to total_possible_matches
>                       - **true**

>               - **false**
>                   - Wait 2 seconds then
>                       - Be wary of waiting programmatically but not being able to control the user from clicking on cards while the program waits execute the reset of the code
>                       - Show card back on both elements that are flipped over
>                       - reset both card_clicked
>                       - variables to null
